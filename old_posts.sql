after all this food insanity I went on a long run up to fort greene only to see elizabeth playing in a horn section on stilts in the fort greene park (!), and then over to prospect park and back home via carroll gardens. it got pretty hot late in the day and I really ran out of gas at the end, at 7 miles it was the longest run I''ve done in a while.<br/><br/>
last night we went to the beer garden in astoria to hang out with friends, huge line as I guess it is pretty trendy now. today I banged out another 4 miles, played some music and took a nap. pretty awesome and perfect weekend.','this weekend',0,'','publish','open','open','','this-weekend','','','2007-07-22 19:14:00','2007-07-23 02:14:00','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=3',0,'post','',0);

1) the headphones suck, and having a nonstandard headphone jack is ridiculous. I had to cut my e3cs with an exacto knife to get them to work with the iphone, and the headphones that ship in the box sound terrible and fit even worse.<br/><br/>
2) the battery randomly drains sometimes. I am convinced this is a result of wifi network activity, as the battery life in general is very good. once every few days, I will wake up to a drained battery when it was fully charged the night before.<br/><br/>
3) notes. I use the notes feature all the time and think it''s great, but I can''t move notes to and from my mac. this sucks, especially if you want to copy and paste directions or other chunks of text.<br/><br/>
as far as complaints, that''s pretty much it from me. the ipod UI, which I use more than anything else, is much improved. I love the way they incorporate album art. videos are amazing and fun to watch, email is super easy, stocks and weather are great, texting is crazy easy and visually appealing, and the web browser is fine (for me at least). worth 600 bucks? I go back and forth on this, for just a phone it''s definitely overkill.<br/><br/>
if you are like me and you are a complete ipod junkie and carry your phone and ipod with you everywhere in your pockets and live in a city where you walk everywhere, then I''d say it''s probably worth it, but just barely :).','thoughts on the iphone',0,'','publish','open','open','','thoughts-on-the-iphone','','','2007-07-23 11:36:51','2007-07-23 15:36:51','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=4',0,'post','',0);

1) jonathan strange and mr. norrell - first fiction book in a while, it''s set in olde england and is about magicians. so far it''s kind of slow going. then again, some of my favorite books were slow starters so hope springs eternal. damn it is raining hard here.<br/><br/>
2) the intelligent investor by benjamin graham, notes by jason zweig. my friend ken lent me this, it''s obviously a great book although it definitely takes a while to absorb. it doesn''t really help that I don''t know a lot of the terms he uses and have to look them up on wikipedia as I go. I feel like I am getting to the meat of it though, he''s currently discussing ways securities can be undervalued.<br/><br/>
3) how equal temperament ruined harmony (and why you should care). about a subject near and dear to my heart, equal temperament vs just intonation. I am super excited to read this, but then again I sing in just intonation almost every day so my opinion on topics like this should be taken with a healthy shot of skepticism.<br/><br/>
4) rat race blues: the musical life of gigi gryce. I used to read jazz biographies voraciously in college, haven''t read one in a long time. gigi gryce was a great alto player who wrote some cool tunes, played on some great sesssions and then left music entirely to be a teacher. I am fascinated by great musicians who leave music, I just don''t really understand it but I guess life can throw you some weird curves.<br/><br/>
as a sidenote, my favorite jazz autobiographies are miles davis'' "miles" (written with quincy troupe) and art pepper''s "straight life". pepper''s book is soul crushingly sad but a great read.','stuff I am reading',0,'','publish','open','open','','stuff-i-am-reading','','','2007-07-23 18:14:40','2007-07-23 22:14:40','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=5',0,'post','',0);

I mean I am after all writing this because I am putting off writing the second half of a tune because there is a Db that can''t find its way back to a Bb, despite having definitely done it before.<br/><br/>
I started writing songs down in standard notation (dots, lines, sharps and flats, that kind of thing) when I was a freshman in college. I was in a jazz band with some friends and wrote some tunes for everyone to play. coming up with the music was easy, getting it down on paper and in a format that other people could parse was another bag entirely. it doesn''t really help that trumpet and clarinet read things in a different key than us guitarists, pianists and bassists, so you have to write out two copies of every tune and keep them in different folders, as well as have extra copies for people who lost their copy and so on. instead of composing for a band being the collective realization of a well written melody, writing music conjured thoughts of driving to kinko''s and tracing over pencil with pen (no 2 pencils, which suck for writing music btw, don''t copy well).<br/><br/>
forunately for us, all that has changed in the past 15 years due to notation software and usable playback. instead of writing some music down, copying it at kinkos and bringing it to rehearsal hoping it sounds good, I can sit in front of a computer and write for a symphony and hear it played back instantly. 20 years ago I would never have been able to hear music written for a large ensemble without considerable cost, today I can buy an orchestral sample library for 250 bucks and hear it all. correct any mistakes, try a section a different way, whatever, it''s all right there.<br/><br/>
notation programs (basically word processors for music) are extremely powerful and can generate parts from a score automatically, transpose everything that needs transposing and apparently also generate figured bass. they can playback your score with rubato, pay attention to dynamic markings and generally turn in a credible, perfectly in tune performance. the new sibelius even comes with post it notes for ideas!<br/><br/>
with multitrack recording software you can basically cut an album in your basement, with programs like ableton live you can take your laptop to a gig and play it. hell, half the gigs on <a href="http://www.jimblack.com/eventsarchive.html">jim black''s gig page</a> feature him on drums/laptop.<br/><br/>
the best thing about all this is it''s all available to anyone. you don''t have to go to school or work in a studio or repurpose your basement, anyone can spend a couple hundred bucks on some software and start cranking out the jams.','writing music is easier than ever.',0,'','publish','open','open','','writing-music-is-easier-than-ever','','','2007-07-26 00:20:54','2007-07-26 04:20:54','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=7',0,'post','',0);

I know, it''s kind of lame not to put the name of the place but I did spend all day in orientation hearing about how it''s not cool to talk to the press or write stuff about the firm, so I''m sure the 3 people reading my blog (hi mom) won''t mind.<br/><br/>
the orientation was actually semi interesting, it''s a big company so they have lots of programs and facilities and investment plans and benefits and all that type of stuff (highlights include a running club, a gym that costs more the higher up you are in the company, and roth 401ks). my orientation was for "experienced hires" (i.e. not recent grads), and every single person there had previously worked at a bank. I guess the hr guy wasn''t kidding when he told me they rarely hired out of industry. anyways I just said I worked in the music business and the hr lady asked me in front of everyone which area. although it took every ounce of self restraint I could muster not to say that I was a fluffer on the last prince tour, I managed to mumble something about digital music and software and tried not to laugh at this awesome mental image I had of the hr lady recoiling in horror. if there''s one thing I am good at it''s laughing at my own jokes so keeping quiet really took a lot out of me and I had to get another cup of coffee afterwards.<br/><br/>
the rest of orientation was fairly uneventful, after that I swung by my new office and met with my new boss and tech lead, both of whom seem pretty cool and interesting. they took me to a meeting where a bunch of economists were talking about credit spreads, which I just learned about recently so I thought that was pretty interesting, I really got the feeling I am going to be learning a lot at my new gig. there definitely seem to be a lot of really smart people that work there, and working with people smarter than you is good stuff. being married to a person that is smarter than you is even better stuff, but I''m getting off topic again which is right behind laughing at my own jokes in the short list of stuff I am good at.','new job.',0,'','publish','open','open','','new-job','','','2007-08-06 22:30:31','2007-08-07 02:30:31','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=10',0,'post','',0);

my parents built us these beautiful bookshelves (which sarah designed) for our apartment. we had a dividing wall between the bed and the living area, but we also had a ton of books in boxes and stacked on windowsills, so we knocked out the wall and put in these bookcases. one of the great things about them is they are 6 boxes that can be stacked in any configuration, so we''ll be able to use them no matter where we live. it''s really awesome having all our books out and accessible again, we both have "to be read" shelves so I''ll post the contents of mine pretty soon. 

the stuff my dad can do with wood is just phenomonal, he can build anything. so far he has built us a hallway cabinet, desks, bookcases, a cd rack (with a very cool infinity inlay) and when I was little he built me a desk. it''s a colonial desk and fit together perfectly solid before it was ever glued, as the entire thing was dovetailed together. I later found out he wanted to use only the tools they would have had available in the time period the desk was from, so he cut every single dovetail by hand. one of my earlier memories is him showing me a pile of wood and telling me it would be a desk someday, and me not believing him. boy was I wrong. thanks, dad.','new bookshelves!',0,'','publish','open','open','','new-bookshelves','','','2007-08-13 19:48:58','2007-08-13 23:48:58','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=11',0,'post','',0);

I have no idea what the budget is like at my current gig, but here''s a real world, just happened to me today example of why I am perplexed by companies not spending a lot of money on hardware in their software engineering groups.<br/><br/>
I was doing a build of our application on an older development box everyone uses, and it was taking between 3 and 5 minutes. not long enough to work on another project simultaneously, not short enough to avoid uncomfortable waits for completion. I remember that my boss told me about another, brand new with all the latest hardware server to use that might be coming online soon, so I check and it is up and no one else is on it. on the new box my build is down to 35 seconds!<br/><br/>
if I can save 3 minutes per build, and I do 20 per day, then that''s an hour a day in saved time. for a team of 5 developers that''s 25 hours/week of people not waiting around for a build to finish. this example today is 11% of my day, and a significantly larger portion of the time I actually spend writing code.<br/><br/>
I don''t really want this to turn into a rant, but if you are going to pay a guy as much money as most developers get paid to write code, I can''t understand why you wouldn''t include the cost of having a new machine on his desk twice a year, and all the latest hardware in the development environment.  hardware just keeps getting cheaper and faster, and yet at my last job I had the same computer for 2 years, and we had to battle for hardware constantly. just yesterday I spent 2 hours with a co worker on a problem we were having because of an outdated operating system, at my previous job the number of application servers in production dropped by half once we got new machines, and saved tons of time during deployment.','on hardware.',0,'','publish','open','open','','on-hardware','','','2007-08-20 18:02:17','2007-08-20 22:02:17','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=14',0,'post','',0);

I took some pretty good hits on my legs and smashed my back against a rock, I now have a large bruise to show for it.  the rest of the day was fun once we got some practice in calmer waters.<br/><br/>

I try to keep an open mind and figured it wouldn''t be that big of a deal, windows isn''t so bad and everyone uses it, etc. now, after spending a month on the dark side, a few thoughts:

1) I really miss <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/expose/">expose</a>. I used it constantly, it is by far the best screen switching tool I have ever used. I still hit F9 on my keyboard, and cry a little inside when nothing happens. if anyone out there can recommend a similar utility for windows I will love you forever.<br/><br/>
2) outlook is infinitely better than mail.app. I used to think mail.app was pretty nice, and it''s fine for personal use, but oh man does outlook destroy it in terms of everything else.<br/><br/>
3) I really miss terminal. I have a love/hate relationship with terminal due to its lack of tabs, but having a unix prompt easily accessible is great and I miss having a unix based operating system. cygwin sucks, dos is horrible and there are no symlinks.<br/><br/>
all in all, windows has made some improvements since I last used it, but I''m still an osx fan at heart and windows just feels like a junky OS to me. it''s clunky, fonts look weird, DOS scares the hell out of me, and I have to download precompiled binaries of open source stuff.','things I miss about osx ',0,'','publish','open','open','','things-i-miss-about-osx','','','2007-09-10 11:01:48','2007-09-10 15:01:48','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=23',0,'post','',0);

many runners swear by the morning, which I agree is a great time to run if you are not a fundamentally morning challenged person, as I am.<br/><br/>
I submit that the best time to run around brooklyn is past 11pm. there is a whole different sort of quiet after 10 or so, when most of the shops are closed and most people are making their way towards the bed. I am putting in more miles in this calm, cool early autumn weather than I ever have before, and it''s almost purely out of enjoying the surroundings instead of worrying about all the things you have to worry about when you are running on the street in the city.','running in brooklyn',0,'','publish','open','open','','running-in-brooklyn','','','2007-09-18 12:49:01','2007-09-18 16:49:01','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=26',0,'post','',0);

having never been to a real boxing gym before, I wasn''t sure what to expect. gleason''s is an old school gym in every way imaginable: no air conditioning, almost no place to sit, hand cranked speed bag platforms and two way balls held down with dumbbells. most of the time, everyone is doing something, and you are probably in the way. it took me until my second lesson to realize something very important about training; all exercises are done by the round, which is demarcated by a stoplight and a bell with three different sounds. the first bell (green) signified the start of a three minute round, the second bell (yellow) tells us there are 30 seconds left in the round, and the third signifies the end of the round and the start of the break, which will last a minute.<br/><br/>
almost everyone in the gym is moving in concert with the bells, and almost everyone does whatever they''re doing a little harder at the 30 second bell. finishing a round strong is important. my typical routine is something like:

- 4 rounds of jump rope<br/><br/>- 4 rounds of heavy bag<br/><br/>- 4 rounds of technique with my trainer, roosevelt.<br/><br/>- 3 rounds of speed bag<br/><br/>
weights, situps and pushups at the end. this weekend I trained on saturday and sunday, about 2 hours each day, and haven''t been this sore in a while.','the sweet science',0,'','publish','open','open','','the-sweet-science','','','2007-10-09 11:08:27','2007-10-09 15:08:27','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=29',0,'post','',0);

- I get a lot more value out of listening to gigs that I feel went poorly than ones that went well. In general, when things are sounding good I am aware of what''s going on and that we are all swinging together, etc. when things are going poorly, it''s often hard to nail down what exactly is going on at the time, and listening back later is often very helpful.<br/><br/>
- It is amazing to me the difference warmup can make. in one practice session, I was kind of sounding rhythmically weird for the first few minutes, then I spent 20 minutes playing along with a jim hall record and I sounded immediately better, and played better for the rest of my session!<br/><br/>
- one non-obvious benefit of recording my practice sessions is I tend to stay much more focused for longer periods. often I have kind of a short attention span when practicing and stop to make a cup of coffee, check email, etc. I don''t really do this when I am recording because I listen to the recordings as background music at work and don''t want to have to listen to me making coffee for 15 minutes. I also don''t want the recordings to be too long, so I typically practice in 30 minute increments then take a break to get water/coffee/whatever.','listening to yourself',0,'','publish','open','open','','listening-to-yourself','','','2007-10-10 10:51:02','2007-10-10 14:51:02','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=30',0,'post','',0);

today I picked up A.J Liebling''s "The Sweet Science" from the library. it''s a collection of essays about boxing, sports illustrated called it one of the all time great sports books, so I am really looking forward to it. of course, since I posted my last books entry my reading time has been cut way down by my very short commute, so I haven''t finished "mr. norrell and jonathan strange" yet, although I am really enjoying it.

<ul>
<li>pete frequently uses a minor chord a half step above to resolve into the next chord, check out the F# melodic minor into Bb7 in bar 16-17, followed by a Bbm back to the F7</li>

<li>in the 3rd chorus, pete plays a Abm-Db7 going into Gm7 instead of the usual Am7-D7</li>

<li>bar 48 is another classic half step resolution from F# to F</li>

<li>he leads into the last 4 bars of the chorus with some kind of C augmented sound a lot.</li>

<li>the last chorus has some really nice lines, bar 82-83 is a classic pete line where he starts things off straightforwardly and then really takes it somewhere interesting.<br/><br/></li>

<br>
rich loved nyc and was always up for some exploring on the weekends, my fondest memory of rich is a day we spent exploring city island in the bronx, and drinking pina coladas and eating french fries on the pier. rich had the worst diet of anyone I''ve ever met, and he explained to me that day that diabetes helped him in this regard because his body burned fat instead of sugar. I never saw rich either get upset about anything, or say a bad word about anyone. he was a kind, giving, easygoing person who enjoyed his life very much, and was always happy to see us and hang out. another great memory I have is when brett connor (a friend from college) came to visit us when we first moved to nyc, we went out for indian food with rich and after a 20 minute meal brett pulled me aside and told me he liked rich a lot, and that he was a really good person. this is not a normal thing for brett to say, so you know rich had to be a special person for him to say something like that so soon after meeting him.<br/><br/><br>
 although rich is gone from our life, both sarah and I feel lucky to have known someone as great as him for as long as we did. it is small comfort, but things could be much worse than they are now. we could have never met him at all.','rich',0,'','publish','open','open','','rich','','','2007-12-19 22:14:07','2007-12-20 02:14:07','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=45',0,'post','',0);

like most musicians with a day job, my typical after work routine involves practicing guitar, playing/writing music, etc. since I use my computer as a music player, and have a lot of cool software for composing, etc, I tend to sit in front of the computer when I practice. unfortunately this also leads to me compulsively and needlessly checking rss feeds and email every few minutes, and basically wasting time checking on random things that pop into my head: should I order new boxing gloves? what''s the weather going to be like tomorrow? how late is fairway open? not exactly pressing, need to know information.<br/><br/>
I''ve tried a number of things to remedy this in the past: deleting browser shortcut from dock, turning off network connection, and good old fashioned resolve. unfortunately none of this has contributed to less browsing the interwebs.<br/><br/>
so last week I just turned my computer off. I turn it on when I need it for something (like transcribing or whatever), and then turn it off when I don''t. if I need to do something on the internet, I sit down, fire up the machine and do it as opposed to interspersing it with practice time. this has really helped my focus a lot, and probably also helps reduce energy consumption. do I really need to have a computer, 2 external hard drives and a external sound card sleeping 24/7 when I use it less than an hour a day?

we went over a basic warmup routine which is a samson stretch, 10 pullups, 10 pushups, 10 situps, 10 squats (bodyweight), 10 back raises per round. we did 3 rounds for time at the end of the workout, everything was doable for me although I lost a lot of steam on the pullups on the 3rd round which I guess is normal.<br/><br/>
on a related fitness note, I also picked up mark rippetoe''s book "starting strength". it''s a howto guide for how to do basic barbell lifts. it''s a pretty crazy book, in that he really only talks about 5 exercises in the whole book. squat, bench press, deadlift, clean, and standing press. his basic workout program is also super simple, there are two workouts:

workout 1 is squat, bench and deadlift. workout 2 is squat, clean, and press. you alternate workouts and don''t train on consecutive days. that''s it. I got the book because I''ve been in a serious lifting rut for the past 10 years or so and I wanted to learn basic exercises the correct way.<br/><br/>
although I''ve been really busy with boxing training and that alone is a great workout, as much as I love it I''ve gotten a little nervous about hurting my hands training and the long term sustainability of it. I think it will be fine if I am careful, but I probably don''t need to be pounding on a heavy bag 4 days a week either. I guess I view learning some weight training and starting crossfit as a way to get in some great workouts on non-boxing days that will be a little more sustainable as I get older.<br/><br/>
all this plus half marathon training means I''m spending a ton of time in the gym and doing physical stuff. I figure I am just on a health kick right now and should go with it until I decide to cut back and focus on something else for a while.

I realize that this will be beyond boring to everyone who is not me, apologies. I recently re-ordered "the listening book", one of my favorite books on music. in it, he talks about improvising practice where you improvise a piece that''s 1 minute, rinse and repeat. I did some of this today, mostly on a blues, as well as working on some clarence white/tony rice bluegrass stuff ("nine pound hammer"). 

also, started a transcription of the 4th variation in bach''s "goldberg variations". it''s in a very lively 6/8, the melody is very cool, and I am incapable of sitting down with a piece of music and doing a harmonic analysis, so I figured I''d transcribe it to try and see what''s happening. only 4 bars in, so we''ll see if I actually finish.','music stuff',0,'','publish','open','open','','music-stuff','','','2008-06-08 21:53:54','2008-06-09 01:53:54','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=76',0,'post','',0);

after writing this I''m pretty interested to read a "real" harmonic analysis and see if they hear the C natural the same way I do.

I really started to enjoy being in shape after I started boxing, as the training was really a whole different level from anything I had done previously. in the typical boxing workout there is a lot of variety, and you are also thinking strategically as well as working towards a clearly defined goal (to hit, and not to get hit). I guess this is why people enjoy team sports, which I have always sucked at and never really enjoyed.<br/><br/>
after I tore a tendon in my knuckle I was a little depressed that I would have to pause my boxing training, but considering how much I use my hands for music and work it was really the only sane choice. I had heard about crossfit and decided to give it a try on my own, first as a complement to my boxing training. I took a 4 week class at the crossfit affiliate in manhattan, but quickly figured out it wouldn''t work for me to attend classes there regularly, as it''s not really near work/home and I hate midtown in general. a few weeks ago I started going to crossfit brooklyn. all the instructors and people there are really good folks, and a lot of what I enjoyed about boxing training I get out of going to crossfit. plus, the best way for me to get there is to run 2 miles, so it''s an easy way to clock 16 miles/week which is not a bad side effect.<br/><br/>
I''ve really been enjoying learning new stuff all the time, and not getting into any kind of fitness rut which is so easy to do. plus, I''ve been posting some pretty good times on some workouts lately, which is very satisfying to me since I was so unathletic when I was younger. I feel pretty lucky to be able to say that at 31, I am in by far the best shape of my life. for now, going to crossfit instead of boxing is really working out well for me in terms of staying off the knuckle and still getting a killer workout. it still takes about 2 hours from when I leave til when I get home, which is a lot of time but I really enjoy it. 

I feel like I''ll eventually start boxing again and probably really get back into it, as I still really enjoy the sport and definitely miss it. but for the time being, doing crossfit stuff is really exciting and definitely is giving me what I need in terms of conditioning.<br/><br/>
I''ve also started thinking a lot more about nutrition in general, but that''s probably a topic for a separate post altogether.

books: 
"sin in the second city" - steve levitt, the author of freakonomics, recommended this highly. about prostitution in chicago<br/><br/>"the count of monte cristo" - this is a classic and by many accounts a real page turner. trying to read more classic works of fiction since it''s an area I haven''t read much in.<br/><br/>
movies:
"the italian job" - the classic 50s version, not the remake<br/><br/>"pirates of the carribean" - never saw it, ppl say it''s good, it''s a good way to kill 2.5 hours<br/><br/>"dial M for murder" - classic hitchcock.<br/><br/>
I''ve been gravitating towards older movies since watching "the sting". it''s worked out pretty well so far, I figure if it was made in the 50s or 60s, and you can get it on itunes, there must be some redeeming qualities to it. plus, so much of what comes out these days is just trash, moviewise. look who sounds over 30, eh!? :)

music:
too much to mention, notable stuff includes tony rice and norman blake''s duo bluegrass record, miles davis and charlie parker''s early quintets, sonny rollins'' prestige stuff, mahler''s 1st symphony, and sting''s "nothing like the sun". hiram bullock, who passed away recently, played awesome on this album.','media for trip!',0,'','publish','open','open','','media-for-trip','','','2008-08-07 22:37:35','2008-08-08 02:37:35','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=95',0,'post','',0);

<img src="http://images36.fotki.com/v1296/photos/7/709861/6601513/IMG_2302-vi.jpg?1219097792" alt="chiles en nogada" />

it''s basically a poblano chile, stuffed with fruit and meat and fried, served in a cold walnut/cream sauce and topped with pomegranate seeds. I was lucky enough to find a vegetarian version. the sauce is almost sweet and the whole dish was very rich.<br/><br/>
like in every region of mexico we''ve visited, mexicans love the chilaquiles for breakfast, here''s a pic from the b&amp;b we stayed at:

<img src="http://images36.fotki.com/v1295/photos/7/709861/6601513/IMG_2319-vi.jpg?1219097966" alt="chilaquiles" />

in the background there''s some eggs served with a house salsa, which is pretty standard also. I can''t remember the name of this popular lunch item:

<img src="http://public.fotki.com/frenchfrywpepper/2008/puebla-mexico/puebla/img_2338jpg.html" alt="?" />

but it''s basically a fried tortilla with huitlacoche (corn mushroom), inside, topped with salsa and crema. these are insanely filling and about $2.<br/><br/>
we walked over to the local market and I bought some mole from this lady, she gave me this green thing to try that was kind of like a banana but had big seeds you had to spit out. sarah didn''t like this, but I thought it was ok. very sweet:

<img src="http://images41.fotki.com/v1299/photos/7/709861/6601513/IMG_2363-vi.jpg?1219098468" alt="banana" />

at the same market, we went to the local (and very popular) cemita shop. a cemita is basically a sandwich made on a round, sesame seed roll. they put a sliced avocado on it, followed by a chipotle chile, then breaded and fried chicken, a whole ton of the oaxacan string cheese (called quesillo), then some sort of ham, and they top it all off with some oil. lol. this place was mobbed and they had a huge sandwich assembly line thing going that would put subway to shame:

I got some awesome chiles from a chile store:

<img src="http://images41.fotki.com/v1264/photos/7/709861/6601513/IMG_2457-vi.jpg?1219099090" />

I tried to buy some brown ones, but the old guy running the store steered me towards these and said they had a lot better flavor.<br/><br/>
sarah had these chalupas for breakfast. amazing thing to note: taco bell didn''t actually make up the term "gordita" as a marketing ploy! they actually exist in mexico, and various mexican ladies will cook them for you.<br/><br/>
<img src="http://images36.fotki.com/v1295/photos/7/709861/6601513/IMG_2512-vi.jpg?1219099577" />

in cholula, which is a smaller town near puebla, we basically had lunch at the quesadilla stands every day. the guys who took us paragliding introduced us to these stands, it''s basically a row of mexican ladies who will cook you a quesadilla, cooked on a hot pemex oil drum top no less, with toppings of your choice. the beautiful thing is, mostly all the options are vegetarian, so there was a lot for me to choose from. blue corn tortillas are the most popular, and they always use quesillo cheese. you can pick huitlacoche, squash flowers, mushrooms, or chicharron (fried pork bits) to go on your quesadilla. we tried everything but the chicharron<br/><br/>
<img src="http://images38.fotki.com/v1276/photos/7/709861/6601518/IMG_2502-vi.jpg?1219099461" />

also, they have a crazy drink they have for dessert which is basically crushed cocoa beans which are mixed with water and foamed. here''s our tour guides enjoying one. these guys were awesome btw, definitely knew how to eat well and enjoy life in general.<br/><br/>
<img src="http://images39.fotki.com/v1290/photos/7/709861/6601518/IMG_2504-vi.jpg?1219099469" />

of course, without ice cream there is only darkness and death, and both me and the mexican population love us some ice cream, so we stopped by la michocan once or twice<br/><br/>
<img src="http://images36.fotki.com/v1295/photos/7/709861/6601515/IMG_2525-vi.jpg?1219099652" alt="" />

for a random ice cream place, they had pretty insanely good ice cream. much, much better than a random ice cream place in the states. of course, one day when we were in there they were all chopping wild strawberries in the seating area, so that may have had something to do with the overall quality.<br/><br/>
the digestif of choice in puebla is called pasita, it''s a raisin liqueur served with a submerged cube of panela cheese and a raisin on a toothpick<br/><br/>
<img src="http://images39.fotki.com/v1285/photos/7/709861/6601513/IMG_2381-vi.jpg?1219098546" alt="" />

the drink to the left is rompope, a barely alcoholic version of mexican eggnog, invented by nuns in puebla. we drank the most pasita at a very cool bar called "la pasita", which had a cool menu<br/><br/>
<img src="http://images41.fotki.com/v1265/photos/7/709861/6601513/IMG_2382-vi.jpg?1219098550" alt="" />

and lots of cool artifacts around the bar<br/><br/>

it looks sort of touristy from the pics, but really was just a cool place to relax and chill.<br/><br/>
we stayed at a fancy b&b in cholula that served a 4 course breakfast everyday that was just ridiculous. yogurt with fruit and homemade bread<br/><br/>
<img src="http://images40.fotki.com/v1263/photos/7/709861/6601515/IMG_2553-vi.jpg?1219099791" alt="" />

fruits with mexican chocolate sauce for dipping<br/><br/>

really good, very fresh eggs<br/><br/>

obviously, you can''t eat this way 3 days in a row without feeling a little ridiculous, but it was included in the price of our stay and to have breakfast by ourselves on their lovely patio was pretty damn awesome. 

also, it wouldn''t be mexico without some delicious molletes<br/><br/>

I think this is a pretty good, if somewhat incomplete summary of our culinary adventures in puebla. other cool things we did which I may or may not write about include eating in one of mexico city''s nicest mexican joints (with a writer from the economist no less!), eating at a few fancy places for dinner in puebla, and shopping for food to take back (mostly mole).','puebla/cholula trip report',0,'','publish','open','open','','pueblacholula-trip-report','','','2008-08-24 17:32:53','2008-08-24 21:32:53','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=96',0,'post','',0);

the specials board read "corn pancakes with coconut milk syrup" on the day we were there, but I can make some pretty good jiffy corn pancakes at home and we didn''t come to boulder to fool around, so I ordered the eggs new orleans: poached eggs with hollandaise sauce served over two fried eggplant slices, with creole tomato sauce. if you are a grizzled breakfast veteran like me, you know that hollandaise sauce is a gutsy move, because it''s either going to suck or be the greatest thing ever. at lucille''s, it''s pretty damn close to the greatest thing ever:

<img src="http://images42.fotki.com/v1320/photos/7/709861/6733528/IMG_2659-vi.jpg" alt="breakfast" />

your breakfast comes with a buttermilk biscuit and grits or potatoes. grits are damn near impossible to screw up and after all I am from the south, so I went with the grits just in case the hollandaise turned out poorly.<br/><br/>
before you get your food, they bring you this:

<img src="http://images38.fotki.com/v1274/photos/7/709861/6733528/IMG_2870-vi.jpg" alt="biscuit" />

fluffy, light, crusty on top, unbelievable, no honey required buttermilk flavor biscuits. for me, this biscuit was as close as I get to having a religous experience. I just didn''t think it was possible to get a biscuit this good in a restaurant. hell, I didn''t realize biscuits this good existed at all. according to the waitress, they freeze the butter, grate it in a cheese grater, and mix it in at the last minute so the biscuits get large air pockets and stay light.<br/><br/>
by the way, lucille''s is from boulder by way of new orleans, so they serve chicory coffee with 20% chicory (less than cafe dumonde), and make their own ketchup and jellies. the coffee is top notch chicory coffee, and they had apple butter, strawberry rhubarb and pepper jelly the two times we visited. yep, it was so good we had to stop back by for lunch on the way to the airport. they serve breakfast all day. have mercy.<br/><br/>
the eggs new orleans were pretty good the first time around, but since we were in colorado, the second time around I got the eggs ponchratrain, poached eggs with hollandaise served over pan fried trout.<br/><br/>
<img src="http://images42.fotki.com/v1315/photos/7/709861/6733528/IMG_2872-vi.jpg" alt="eggs" />

I got the potatoes this time because the grits were good but unremarkable and I wanted to try the homemade ketchup. potatoes were a bit overdone but excellent with ketchup all the same. the trout was the single best dish I had in colorado, and we ate pretty good. very fresh, crisp exterior and flaky on the inside. they must make the hollandaise to order, I can''t see how they could get it that perfect everytime otherwise.<br/><br/>
anyways, lucille''s is my idea of a perfect restaurant. staff is cool, service is casual but good, the old house is awesome (there''s a second bathroom upstairs, the glass doorknobs reminded me of my grandmothers house), and the food is damn close to divine.','the best buttermilk biscuits in the world...',0,'','publish','open','open','','the-best-buttermilk-biscuits-in-the-world','','','2008-09-24 23:03:02','2008-09-25 03:03:02','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=98',0,'post','',0);

In this workout you move from each of five stations after a minute. This is a five-minute round from which a one-minute break is allowed before repeating. the workout is 3 Rounds. The stations are:

Wall-ball: 20/14/10 pounds   10/8 ft target. (Reps)
Sumo deadlift high-pull: 75/55/45 pounds (Reps)
Box Jump: 20"/15"/10" (Reps)
Push-press: 75/55/45 pounds (Reps)
Row: calories (Calories)

here''s everyone warming up:
<img src="http://images43.fotki.com/v1322/photos/7/709861/6749205/IMG_2899-vi.jpg" />

I started on the rower, which is tough because rowing takes a lot out of you and then you move directly to throwing a heavy ball high in the air, which uses a lot of the same muscles. charmel and I rowing (note the awesome pullup bar + jungle gym in the background!):

<img src="http://images38.fotki.com/v1279/photos/7/709861/6749205/IMG_2913-vi.jpg" />

wall balls with a 20lb ball. this is pretty tough, on the squat portion your knees must break paralell with your hips. there''s a target on the wall that you have to hit:

<img src="http://images40.fotki.com/v1335/photos/7/709861/6749205/IMG_2919-vi.jpg" />

deadlift high pulls. this or rowing was probably my strongest exercise:

<img src="http://images38.fotki.com/v1275/photos/7/709861/6749205/IMG_2929-vi.jpg" />

push press, my last exercise in the round. in this, you basically dip slightly and then explosively extend your hips, driving the bar from your chest to above your head:

<img src="http://images38.fotki.com/v1276/photos/7/709861/6749205/IMG_2931-vi.jpg" />

me resting in between rounds. laying on your back is the most effective way to recover and everyone does it:

a picture of everyone at the end:

<img src="http://images38.fotki.com/v1270/photos/7/709861/6749205/IMG_2949-vi.jpg" />

my score was 235, which is pretty good. it''s very hard to get a sense of how difficult this workout is until you do it, I had only done it once before and mostly forgot how hard it was. watching how wrecked everyone in the first heat was reminded me of how demanding it is. having a lot of spectators and doing it for charity, as well as all the people videotaping, really spurred me on.<br/><br/>
afterwards, we were all messing around on the equipment, and sarah got this very cool pic of me doing a muscle up on the rings (basically you start from a hanging position, and then get to where your arms are fully extended and holding your torso above the rings):

<img src="http://images43.fotki.com/v1326/photos/7/709861/6749205/IMG_2941-vi.jpg" />

basically from a hang, you get into this position:

<img src="http://images43.fotki.com/v1330/photos/7/709861/6749205/IMG_2942-vi.jpg" />

and then just press yourself up, fully extending your arms. I can do one, which is a pretty good accomplishment as they require some strength as well as technique, and am working on string multiple muscleups together. it''s a basic gymnastics move, and really makes you realize how strong and coordinated gymnasts are.<br/><br/>

I dunno, the timing just seems wrong to me regarding most of these helpful financial meltdown tips. it''s never a good idea to invest short-term reserves in equities, even when the market is going up, and it''s not a new idea that small companies should try and save money where they can.<br/><br/>
I have noticed that I am kind of emotionally immune to swings in the market like those in the past week,
I suspect it''s been beaten out of me after years of playing online poker, where losing 20% of my working bankroll was just another day at the office in the shorthanded NL games online. that said, I remember very well how shell-shocked I was the first time I lost a thousand bucks playing poker, at the now defunct playstation, an underground cardroom in nyc. Fortunately, I knew the games were good so I kept playing. Everything worked out just fine and poker was a great supplemental income for me for many years, but I''m pretty sure on the train ride home I told myself I should quit playing several times.<br/><br/>
I can''t help but imagine that a lot of people are going through this same kind of "holy shit I just lost a lot of money" hangover, and from experience I know it''s not fun. however, as any gambler will tell you it''s part of the game, and I have always viewed finance as just like any other gamble. I also know that it''s only money and my strongest emotion through this whole meltdown has been to feel lucky enough to have money to lose in the markets.<br/><br/>
one other thought. the other day, I referred to some way of thinking as being "results oriented" and the person I was talking to thought I meant it as a positive thing. completely understandable, but it was kind of a mindfuck for me since that term is kind of a putdown among poker players. if someone lays you 3:2 on a coinflip, you book it. whining about it if things don''t go your way is just being results oriented. it''s clearly the right decision to gamble getting those odds (as long as you can afford it) as your bet has a positive expected value, so you should welcome the action and not worry about the results. anyways, it''s very easy to think in a results oriented kind of way, but usually also not a very helpful way to make decisions. all the same, I often catch myself making results oriented decisions, like switching traffic lanes, and it''s easy to slip into this way of thinking.','thoughts on financial meltdown',0,'','publish','open','open','','thoughts-on-financial-meltdown','','','2008-10-11 17:19:04','2008-10-11 21:19:04','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=103',0,'post','',0);

<a href="http://www.paulsanwald.com/mp3s/two_thirds.mp3">two thirds</a> is a trio for oboe, french horn and cello. the reading on this recording isn''t perfect but for a first reading it''s pretty good. the assignment was to have an event at the center of the piece, and another at the point of the golden ratio, 61.8% of the way through. this was a bit strange for me to do and I ended up writing a lot more and then hacking large chunks out to get it to come out right.<br/><br/><br/>

<a href="http://www.paulsanwald.com/mp3s/elocution.mp3">elocution</a> is a chaconne written for solo violin. the basic structure of a chaconne is a theme developing over a short, repeating harmonic sequence, usually in triple meter. kind of an intimidating thing to write, since bach''s chaconne for solo violin is considered by many to be the greatest piece of music ever written. nevertheless, I managed to bang something out. the wrinkle in this assignment was that no note can be undecorated, everything had to have some type of accent or articulation marking.<br/><br/>','more music from juilliard',0,'','publish','open','open','','more-music-from-juilliard','','','2008-11-30 23:39:23','2008-12-01 03:39:23','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=108',0,'post','',0);

in a large stockpot, saute 1 onion, 2 cloves garlic, a diced fuji apple, a bay leaf and 1 teaspoon kosher salt in 2 tablespoons oil. I used grapeseed oil we just picked up from fairway, it tastes great, is supposedly healthy and has a high smoke point. anyways, when the onion is soft add a pound and a half ofcauliflower, 3 1/4 cups of stock and 1/4 cup apple juice if you have it (if not, just use stock or water). cook until cauliflower is fall apart tender, and fish out the bay leaf. puree until the soup is smooth.<br/><br/>

INSERT INTO "wp_posts" VALUES (141,2,'2009-06-28 17:19:59','2009-06-28 21:19:59','This afternoon I did a quick transcription of Kenny Garrett''s solo on "Solid", a blues in Bb written by Sonny Rollins. The transcription is from Woody Shaw''s album of the same name, which features Kenny Garrett on alto along with Peter Leitch, Kenny Barron, Neil Swainson and Victor Jones.<br/><br/>
<br/> <a href="/pdfs/kenny_solid.pdf">Here''s a link to the PDF</a>. <a href="/mp3s/kenny_solid.mp3">The MP3 is here</a>.<br/><br/>
<br/>Kenny was only about 26 on this date, but he already had his own sound and conception. He has always been a master of building intensity, and this solo is no exception. The first chorus is relatively spare and he leaves lots of space between ideas. By the third chorus, he is furiously double timing. Kenny likes to lean on altered notes of the Bb7, especially at the end of each chorus. He uses a straight up F harmonic minor scale over the Bb7 going to Eb7, this isn''t something I''ve heard often and I found it very interesting. Another interesting substitution he uses is Abm7-Db7 instead of Dm7-G7 leading into the Cm7 chord at the end. He plays a Dm7 arpeggio directly before the Am7, which makes it sound especially striking. The strangest phrase from a notation perspective was the descending blues scale starting in bar 41. He crams in 4 notes before the downbeat of 42, yet clearly doesn''t start his phrase until after beat 3. Since the meter of his phrase is roughly eighth notes, I notated it a 16th note off, but in playing this phrase, I hear it as starting on beat 3 and just lay far behind the beat. 

<br/>There''s a few things the transcription doesn''t reflect. The first is accurate chord changes; It''s a Bb blues, and the chord symbols in the PDF are basically just standard jazz blues changes. Kenny Barron does some great comping throughout, none of the intricacies are reflected in my chord symbols. The second thing I don''t attempt to get 100% accuracy on is rhythmic feel; Kenny is a master of laying back and pushing the beat. The way I learn rhythmic intricacies is by playing along with the soloist. While I think it can be useful to have them in the notation, you can only go so far.<br/><br/>

<a href="/mp3s/woody_missjones.mp3">Here''s an MP3</a> of the solo and <a href="/pdfs/woody_missjones.pdf">here is my transcription</a>.<br/><br/>
This transcription is not completely accurate, Woody loves to play odd groupings of notes over beats and his 16th note lines don''t line up perfectly against the beat, and I am bad at notating such things. The double time line starting at measure 17 is a great example of this kind of displaced feeling. I can play it, but can''t really notate it accurately.<br/><br/>
This is an interesting solo in that Woody plays a lot of very conventional beboppish phrases, like the iii-vi-ii-V line at the end of the first chorus, but over the same progression in the second chorus he plays a brilliant triplet figure that is completely his own. Also interesting is the amount of variety he uses in his rhythms over two choruses. straight eights, exaggerated triplet eights, lots of triplet and 16th note lines as well as the aforementioned odd groupings. Finally, Woody''s articulation sets him apart from every other jazz trumpeter I have ever heard, his use of stacatto and shortened notes seems completely unique to me.','Woody Shaw''s Solo on "Have You Met Miss Jones"',0,'','publish','open','open','','woody-shaws-solo-on-have-you-met-miss-jones','','','2009-09-13 20:51:31','2009-09-14 00:51:31','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=143',0,'post','',0);

You can <a href="/mp3s/peter_chant.mp3">listen here</a>. The usual lazy jazz musician transcription rules apply, I don''t mark any slurs or accents or anything, that stuff is best gotten directly from the source. These transcriptions really serve as more of a reminder of the harmonic and rhythmic material Peter uses over these types of tunes.<br/><br/>
The CD this is taken from, "Brain Dance", was the first jazz guitar CD I heard that made me really excited about jazz guitar. I got it when I was in college, about 19 or 20. I was fairly serious about learning jazz, but had focused my listening on Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and the other traditional jazz heavyweights. I didn''t listen to too many guitar players and when I did, I honestly didn''t really hear many recordings where the guitarist was just part of the band, but had equal footing as a melodic and harmonic voice. So this CD really woke me up to the possibilities of the guitar in a jazz ensemble. The other immediate reaction I had was: "Wow, I want to sound like THAT". I think every musician I know has had kind of a role model, and Peter was definitely a model for me in that way.<br/><br/>
I have been lucky enough to hear Peter play a lot since then, take a lesson, and also to make his acquaintance over the years. A few thoughts on his general technique:
- Peter mostly uses 3 fingers, only occasionally shifting to the pinky in his lines.<br/><br/>- he plays up and down the neck quite a bit, as opposed to moving across the strings while playing lines. he shifts positions really quickly.<br/><br/>- he uses a very subtle and distinctive vibrato quite frequently on long notes.<br/><br/>
This solo shows Peter''s strong Grant Green influence and has a lot of great lines, and more importantly, showcases his awesome, laid back feel. Notice the flurries of 16ths in his second chorus. A lot of people say Peter doesn''t play many notes, but he does bust out the double time really effectively, especially in medium and slow tempos like this.<br/><br/>

In order to work on this, I''m going to work on transcribing and obviously playing some great solo breaks.

<img src="/images/blog/phil.png" alt="phil" width="600" />

After practicing this break and similar phrases, a few observations:
- phil delays the resolution by a beat by landing on the A - C - Bb for the first three eighth notes. this sounds really nice.<br/><br/>- it also sounds pretty good to just lay out the first measure, and play something leading in to the I chord. starting on any note in a Cm chord on the first beat of the second measure will land you on some Bb chord tone on the first beat. practicing singing resolutions like that is pretty useful. also, once you have that first note of the second measure in your ear, it''s easy to start your line in the first measure, essentially working backwards.','breaks: phil woods on "Webb City"',0,'','publish','open','open','','breaks-phil-woods-on-webb-city','','','2009-10-20 21:45:52','2009-10-21 01:45:52','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=145',0,'post','',0);

A couple of notes:
- Peter loves to play Ab minor over a G dominant when resolving to C. I''ve marked where he does this in this solo, but he does it a lot in general. 
- He also plays a lot of really nice big arpeggios leading into more scalar melodic stuff, like in measures 12, 27, 55 and 60. I think these types of lines sound great and are a real hallmark of his style.<br/><br/>- He plays the same triplet arpeggio line over C major in measures 17 and 21 but gets out of it in two different ways.<br/><br/>- Measures 43-44, where he plays the 9th and 13th of the ii and V chords strike me as another signature phrase.','Peter Bernstein''s solo on "Lady Bird"',0,'','publish','open','open','','peter-bernsteins-solo-on-lady-bird','','','2009-11-01 14:54:32','2009-11-01 18:54:32','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=146',0,'post','',0);

I was a little surprised to discover that bach actually does this kind of thing all the time, but he resolves these dissonances into imperfect consonances (6ths or 3rds). so for example if he has a D quarter note in the bass, and a C eighth note melody, he''ll move that note to Bb in the next eighth. this opens up a lot more possibilities in terms of writing, as these dissonances are often a pain to avoid, especially in cadences.<br/><br/>
another "rule" in the way bach resolves dissonance is that if he uses a dissonance, any note that can be resolved by a half step, should be. this means that in two voice writing, if you have C and F, the F should be resolved to E. for B and F, B goes to C and F to E. always resolve by half step if possible.','further notes on the bach style',0,'','publish','open','open','','further-notes-on-the-bach-style','','','2010-01-20 23:45:44','2010-01-21 03:45:44','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=151',0,'post','',0);

As always, this transcription is more of a guide than an attempt to be 100% accurate. Red plays some great, long classic bebop lines on this. He likes to accent the highest note of the phrase, which he often places on a strong beat. I''ve put a marcato where he gives a pronounced accent.<br/><br/>
Paul plays some very interesting lines in this and always picks interesting notes, check out the Eb - D - C line he plays starting in bar 11. Also, check out his super high line (which I have in treble clef) starting in bar 13! he really uses the full range of the bass, and this really adds a lot of intensity to the music.

The quintet featured Tom Harrell on trumpet and fluegelhorn, and it was a unique chance to hear Tom blowing in such a straight ahead setting. The rhythm section was Willie Brown III on the drums, Ray Drummond on the bass and Jeb Patton at the piano.<br/><br/>
They kicked off the set with "Budlike", a medium uptempo blues written by Charles. From the first notes of the melody, right away I noticed Charles'' tremendous <em>sound</em>, even when he was playing off mic, his authoritative sound filled the club. Tom took the first solo and played his fluegelhorn beautifully, with his distinctive muted tone and uncommonly clear ideas. I was surprised to see him switch to trumpet for the remainder of the set, as I have mostly seen him perform exclusively on fluegelhorn in recent years. Interestingly, he gets a very similar muted sound on trumpet, I was sitting directly in front of him the whole set and didn''t hear any of the bright, almost cutting sound you hear when directly in front of a trumpet. Ray and Willie traded choruses for a collective bass/drums solo, that kind of conversation is something I wish I heard more often.<br/><br/>
The next tune was an uptempo version of "The Song Is You", followed by a Tom Harrell feature on his tune "Suspended Motion", a straight 8ths piece with sometimes ambiguous harmonies. I know this tune, and it was really interesting to hear a player of Charles'' generation navigate a tune like this. Of course he sounded great, and perhaps a bit more thoughtful than on the earlier tunes.<br/><br/>
They followed up with an uptempo version of "Spring Is Here", followed by another Harrell composition, "Blues In Six", a loping, "not-quite a blues" blues. Jeb Patton took a great solo on this one, channeling McCoy Tyner and then getting into some stacatto chords that sounded really fresh in this context. The final tune was "Tenor Madness", with Willie Jones, who swung his ass off and played great the whole, building into a fiery solo. Charles and Tom traded over choruses, then fours, and finally twos before taking it out.<br/><br/>

- Don''t try to avoid using synchronized, and other java concurrency abstractions. it''s very difficult to get right, and usually doesn''t buy you very much to try. even Doug Lea gets this stuff wrong.<br/><br/>
problem:
example:x=y=0<br/><br/>Thread 1: x=1; j=y<br/><br/>Thread 2: i=x; y=1<br/><br/>
how can i=0 <em>and</em> j=0? this is obviously not intuitive, as it appears from the order of the statements that both i and j could never both be 0. however, the compiler/jvm/processor could analyze the assignments as independent events and reverse the order of the statements in the threads (e.g Thread 2: y=1; i=x), leaving us with the possibility that both i and j can end up as 0. the takeaway here is that there are very few assumptions you can make about thread interaction without explicit synchronization.<br/><br/>
- don''t rely on locks flushing stuff. releasing a lock only matters if there is a subsequent acquire.<br/><br/>
- if a field can be accessed by multiple threads, and at least one of those accesses is a write, you should either use locking to prevent simultaneous accesses, or make the field volatile. synchronization is hard to get right, volatile is a bit harder to get right, try to use any other technique to prevent a "data race", and you will NOT get it right.<br/><br/>
properties of volatile:
- reads and writes go directly to memory<br/><br/>- volatile logs and doubles are atomic<br/><br/>- volatile reads and writes cannot be reordered<br/><br/>- <em>reads and writes become acquire/release pairs.</em>. volatile write happens-before all following reads of the same variable. a volatile write is similar to unlock, a volatile read is similar to a lock.<br/><br/>
the danger of not using volatile, is that a non-volatile variable can be optimized by the compiler to be kept in a register instead of written to global memory. this is because compiler optimizations and transformations are performed on single threaded code.<br/><br/>
initializing singletons. this code doesn''t work:

Helper helper;

Helper getHelper() {
if (helper == null)
    synchronized(this) {
        if (helper==null)
           helper = new Helper();
     }
}
return helper;
}

this is common code, but actually broken. the problem with this code is that there is locking on the side of the writer of helper, but not on the side of the reader. it''s possible for someone to come along and read that helper!=null, but get a junk value for helper. the fix is to add a volatile modifier to the declaration of Helper:
private volatile Helper;

even better solution is to use the effective java pattern "Initialization on Demand Holder Idiom" in effective java.<br/><br/>
immutable objects are obviously great for thread safety. final fields don''t allow other threads to see an object until construction is complete.<br/><br/>
even if you are using a ConcurrentHashMap, if you are doing a get, some stuff, then a put, even though get and put are thread safe, you still need to lock on the "some stuff" section of your code. people who write the JDK even make this mistake, so watch for it.<br/><br/>
use @ThreadSafe, @NotThreadSafe, @GuardedBy, @immutable annotations to document your code. some of these are checked by FindBugs.<br/><br/>
make code correct, then worry about making it fast. fast concurrent code amounts to reducing sync costs, use java.util.concurrent and java.nio classes, and reducing lock scope.<br/><br/>

sonic research turbo tuner - ridiculously accurate tuner. I have shied away from using tuners in the past, preferring to tune to the piano or bass on a gig, but I''ve been doing more big band gigs recently and it''s really nice to be able to check tuning silently and quickly.<br/><br/>
fulltone fulldrive 2 - I borrowed one of these from my friend Dan for a gig recently, and it''s the best sounding overdrive pedal I''ve tried for an archtop and solid state amp combo. I tried a few of the other fulltone models, but nothing sounded as good as this for my setup.<br/><br/>
digitech rv-3 reverb - pretty standard reverb pedal, sounds great and I don''t have any complaints.<br/><br/>
electro harmonix POG2 - I have always liked octave pedals and this really takes it to the next level. you can create some really cool, organ like sounds with this.<br/><br/>

The power supply is a voodoo labs pp2+. this was expensive, but really worth it, as it has an AC outlet, which the jamman needs, in addition to lots of other power slots for the other pedals. I questioned getting this at first, but I''m really glad I did.<br/><br/>
the board itself is a pedaltrain board, which is designed to work with the voodoo labs power supply, in that it mounts comfortably underneath.','',0,'','inherit','open','open','','163-revision-3','','','2010-05-23 13:44:18','2010-05-23 17:44:18','',163,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=167',0,'revision','',0);

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Too-Big-Fail-Washington-System/dp/0670021253">Too Big To Fail</a> - A great insider''s account of the events leading up to the lehman failure. It''s a real page turner, I found it hard to put down and there are lots of great anecdotes. This is the best business book I''ve read since "A Conspiracy of Fools".<br/><br/>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Regular-Expressions-Jeffrey-Friedl/dp/0596528124/ref=cm_srch_tsr_rtr">Mastering Regular Expressions</a> - I read this on the recommendation of the guys who developed django, the python web framework. It''s a great technical book which unravels the mysteries of regular expressions in a clear, systematic way. I''d recommend this book to any programmer, regardless of language or technology you work in. I get more stuff done faster because of this book.<br/><br/>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thelonious-Monk-Times-American-Original/dp/0684831902/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1280977289&sr=1-1">Thelonious Monk: The Life and Times of an American Original</a> - A wonderful biography of one of the greatest musicians ever. It''s very detailed, and really gives a great picture of Monk''s world and what his life was like. Dispels a lot of rumors, and offers the best explanation of Monk''s later years than anything else I''ve read.<br/><br/>

I started by going to Staubitz, the best butcher in NYC if not the world, and getting 6lbs of bone in shoulder, for only $18!<br/><br/>
I then brined the meat in salt, sugar and liquid smoke for 2 hours. After it was done brining, I painted it with a wet rub of mustard and liquid smoke, then coated it with a dry rub of salt, sugar, smoked paprika, and cayenne.<br/><br/><img src="http://images56.fotki.com/v713/photos/1/709861/9071246/IMG_6400-vi.jpg" alt="before cooking" />

All in all, this is one of the most successful cook''s illustrated recipes I''ve tried, and the pulled pork is better than any I''ve had in NYC. Of course, it''s no substitute for my favorite bbq joint, Backyard BBQ in Durham, NC, but then again, what is?

It was a great trip, thanks in part to James Kaiser''s wonderful guide book, <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/acadiarevealedco/detail/0982517203">Acadia</a>, which might be the best guide book I''ve ever come across.<br/><br/>
We stayed in Southwest Harbor, which was a great choice, as Bar Harbor seemed a bit too touristy, and Northwest Harbor was pretty dead this time of year. We got in on a friday evening, and I had the best crab cakes ever at red sky, a really nice local restaurant<br/><br/>

We spent most of our days hiking in Acadia national park. On saturday, after an excellent breakfast of blueberry pancakes at 2 Cats in bar harbor, we hiked a coastal trail from sand beach to otter ridge and back. hiking along the rocks was a ton of fun, and made me feel like a kid again.<br/><br/>

Later in the day we drove out to Thurston''s, which several locals told us was the best lobster shack on the island. well worth the drive, it was definitely the best lobster I''ve eaten.<br/><br/>

Dinner was at Maggie''s in Bar Harbor, Sarah and I shared the crab au gratin and seafood provencal, both were excellent. I also tried an atlantic brewing company "coal porter" with dinner, it was a really nice porter, not too sweet.<br/><br/>
The next day we had breakfast at grumpy''s in southwest harbor, they make their own corned beef hash and bread, and it was pretty good. We spent the afternoon hiking up Acadia mountain:

The views were spectactular, and the hike was surprisingly challenging given the elevation change was only 500 feet. That night we ate at another local southwest harbor place, the fiddler''s green. again, excellent food and drink, I highly recommend the smoked mussels, which are smoked on the premises, and the allagash black, which I didn''t know was a maine beer.<br/><br/>
our last full day we started with breakfast at 2 Cats for a second time, this was even more awesome than the first time because I got the lobster omlette with smoked gouda and a biscuit, both were exceptional. We then hiked to the top of champlain mountain, my folks took a relatively tame trail and sarah and I took the precipice, which was a few steps away from out and out rock climbing. this was really fun and I highly recommend it, if you don''t mind heights:

Our final day there, yesterday, we drove down to seawall and hiked the wonderland trail, an easy coastal walk, before heading out of town. lots of cool tide pools<br/><br/>

followed by a stop in somesville, and an excellent lunch at mother''s sandwich shack. Mount Desert Island was great and I''m looking forward to going back, although we wouldn''t have wanted to go any later in the year, as most shops and restaurants close up for the season. I''m guessing the sweet spot is right after school starts but before columbus day.<br/><br/>
all in all, a great, very active but relaxing trip!<br/><br/>

For all its half truths and stories, Miles Davis'' autobiography was a fantastic read for me as a young musician just starting to get into jazz. His constant praise of the young dynamo tony williams, who joined his quintet at 18, was enough to send me and my hard earned money to schoolkids records to pick up the first record with tony williams on it I could find.<br/><br/>
as fate would have it, I got "in a silent way" and rushed home to hear tony beat straight time on the high hat for 20 minutes; hardly the transcendent experience I was after. This experience made hearing "so what" from the "four and more" album all the more like an uppercut flush on the chin, I had never heard anything like tony''s explosive drumming, and still haven''t. his chattering ride swings out a beat without ever repeating himself, the rest of his kit he uses to drop thundering cannonballs behind miles, george coleman, and finally herbie.<br/><br/>
later that year, my freshman year of college, my folks asked me what I wanted for christmas, and I asked for the boxed set that documented every note the miles davis quintet played at the plugged nickel, a club in chicago, right before the christmas of 1965. I''ve enjoyed the music for years, but never listened to the whole thing from start to finish until this week.<br/><br/>
Some notes on the music: it''s surprising how often they play the same tunes from set to set, I''m not sure what kind of record miles is going for with "I fall in love too easily", but they certainly played it enough in 2 nights work. The music doesn''t have the raw punk rock energy of that famous 1964 concert, but it does have Wayne Shorter on tenor, who manages to steal most of the show throughout. His solo on "Four" is one of the most furious things on the set, and his honking call and response on "All Blues" juxtaposes a honking motif with an onslaught of thinking man''s blues all at once.<br/><br/>
The interplay between bandmates is frequently astonishing, herbie grinds down the tempo to a slow blues on the second reading of "no blues" and tony is with him the whole way, things get picked back up to pace (and then some) by the time miles re-enters. My favorite herbie solo is on the first rendition of "milestones", although his comping is genius throughout, particularly his and wayne shorter''s interplay during the second "agitation". My favorite Miles solo on this is probably the second "If I were a bell", his horn is strong and clear, although his melodies are always direct, particularly on ballads; "when I fall in love" is also a favorite.<br/><br/>
I''ve noticed referencing the second rendition of many of these tunes over a two night span, this band liked to play a lot of the same tunes over and over, and things heated up considerably over those two days.<br/><br/>
The music in this set is wonderful, and listening to it straight through was an interesting way to really try and get inside what they did at the plugged nickel that week. this music is cerebral, raw and gutsy, and also a little hard to understand, but, as always, listening deeply gets you closer to understanding the truth of it.','listening notes: live at the plugged nickel',0,'','publish','open','open','','listening-notes-live-at-the-plugged-nickel','','','2010-11-09 22:44:38','2010-11-10 02:44:38','',0,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=216',0,'post','',0);

His solo on "Four" is one of the most furious things on the set, and his honking call and response on "All Blues" juxtaposes a honking motif with an onslaught of thinking man''s blues all at once.<br/><br/>
The interplay between bandmates is frequently astonishing, herbie grinds down the tempo to a slow blues on the second reading of "no blues" and tony is with him the whole way, things get picked back up to pace (and then some) by the time miles re-enters. My favorite herbie solo is on the first rendition of "milestones", although his comping is genius throughout, particularly his and wayne shorter''s interplay during the second "agitation". My favorite Miles solo on this is probably the second "If I were a bell", his horn is strong and clear, although his melodies are always direct, particularly on ballads; "when I fall in love" is also a favorite.<br/><br/>
I''ve noticed referencing the second rendition of many of these tunes over a two night span, this band liked to play a lot of the same tunes over and over, and things heated up considerably over those two days.<br/><br/>
The music in this set is wonderful, and listening to it straight through was an interesting way to really try and get inside what they did at the plugged nickel that week. this music is cerebral, raw and gutsy, and also a little hard to understand, but, as always, listening deeply gets you closer to understanding the truth of it.','listening notes: live at the plugged nickel',0,'','inherit','open','open','','216-revision','','','2010-11-09 22:44:35','2010-11-10 02:44:35','',216,'http://www.paulsanwald.com/wp/?p=217',0,'revision','',0);

Mostly, it''s the same group of people, every now and then someone coming or going. A couple sundays ago, after we had finished with our day''s work, my trainer Dorrius asked me how many rounds I had done. I said I wasn''t sure, because it''s hard to keep count, but I think it was at least 20, because it was almost 2 in the afternoon and I had gotten there at 11, and hadn''t taken but a couple rounds off.<br/><br/>
Dorrius said that the key to going a lot of rounds is to stay relaxed, which is easier said than done in a boxing ring. Later that week, on a gig, I noticed while I was playing that my shoulders were tense, and I had to tell myself to relax. I played better, and felt better, for the rest of the gig. One of the things I love about having multiple vocations is finding similarities between them, learning something in one discipline and then applying it successfully to another. Lessons learned through this kind of experience stay with me; I didn''t play much poker in 2010, but not a day goes by that I don''t use something I learned at the poker table.<br/><br/>
2010 was an interesting year for me. Musically, I studied orchestration and conducting at juilliard, got my first freelance arranging job, and was lucky enough to gig regularly with musicians who are better than me, the best way to learn and improve. I also played my first bluegrass guitar gig, and started playing classical guitar again after taking a multi-year break.<br/><br/>
Professionally, I had a very busy year at work. My job and role changed quite a bit, and it''s been challenging to adapt to that. I also started several coding projects outside of my regular day job, which I hadn''t really done previously. Both projects are in new languages for me; Python and Objective-C. I read more technical books in the past year than I read in the 10 years before that.<br/><br/>
Physically, I started boxing again, and stopped doing crossfit. Boxing was something I loved almost instantly after I started several years ago, and even though I took several years off due to an injured hand, I love the sport and am glad and fortunate to train at a great gym on a regular basis. I really do miss the crossfit south brooklyn crew, and sharing that experience with Sarah, though. Also, I lost 15 pounds this past year, which kind of freaked me out, as I didn''t really need to lose any weight, but I feel fine and look ok, so I guess it is what it is.<br/><br/>
The one thing I didn''t do enough of, is spend time with all the people I love. I accomplished quite a lot this past year, but didn''t always make time for everyone in my life that I care about. When I look back on 2011, I hope my first thought will be of time spent with friends, family, and loved ones. Work is important, music is important, personal goals and achievements are all really important. But nothing is more important than the people you love, and the people that love you.

INSERT INTO "wp_posts" VALUES (237,2,'2011-02-26 15:45:01','2011-02-26 19:45:01','When people find out I''m a composer, their reaction is usually something along the lines of "I could never do that", or similar. Writing music is one of the very, very few things that comes pretty naturally for me, but I understand the "I could never do that in a million years" feeling, because I am incapable of drawing even the most basic pictures.<br/><br/>
I thought I''d write up a post on how I generally write music, both because I think every composer is a bit different, and as a way of de-mystifying the process a bit for anyone reading that isn''t a musician.<br/><br/>
My friends Evan and Diana asked me to write and play some music for the candle lighting ceremony for their wedding. This provided me with the first, most important thing I need in order to compose anything: A Deadline. there are many areas of life where I am very self motivated and productive: practicing guitar 3+ hours per day no matter what, waking up at ungodly hours of the morning to go boxing, shipping software at work, etc. Unfortunately, and maybe because it comes somewhat naturally, I am not very disciplined about composing and pretty much need some kind of deadline in order to get anything done. Once I have a deadline, I think about the piece and generally procrastinate until I reach the point where I must get it done, which, for the purposes of Evan and Diana''s wedding, puts us at two saturdays ago, a week before the wedding. I have committed to playing, but haven''t written a note.<br/><br/>
First thing I do is fire up Sibelius, which is like a word processor for music. I used to write with a pencil and paper on score paper, but I stopped doing that years ago and usually write directly in Sibelius these days. Next, I decide what instruments I am going to use in my score. I am a guitarist, it is going to be just me playing at the wedding, why would I need to make this decision, shouldn''t I write a score for guitar? For plenty of composers, I''m sure the answer is yes. But for me, I want to write something beautiful, majestic and stately, and when I think of those things, I think string quartet. I''ll write something for string quartet, and figure out how to play it on guitar later.<br/><br/>
I start with a blank score for 2 violins, viola, and cello. I decide on a waltz, and set the key to G. For me, the process of composing is a pushing and pulling of the melody and the harmony. in a string quartet, I generally start my sketch with the outer voices: a bass line, and a melody line. Sometimes, the bass line will suggest a melody line, and other times, the melody will suggest a harmony to go against it. One of the more interesting decisions you can make when composing is when to go against what first "suggests" itself in the other voice, my melody note may be D, and I may initially hear a G under it, but what if I decide to avoid that, and rather go for a Bb in the bass. It will mean I will have to re-write some parts from before, but that''s ok. Sometimes, this decision will ripple all the way back through the piece to the very beginning, and end up changing the character.<br/><br/>
For Evan and Diana''s piece, I actually wrote the first 4 bars of the bassline first, and decided to borrow an F chord instead of staying in G the whole time. I find it extra easy to write very nice tonal music and sometimes need to make a conscious effort to go outside the key a bit. my score now looks like this:

<img src="/images/blog/first.png"/>

I keep going with the violin and cello, but if I hear any inner lines, I go ahead and write them in. the ideas I have for those may take over the main melody, or suggest a harmony also. an example of that is the viola line in my sketch<br/><br/>
<img src="/images/blog/inner.png"/>

this process is essentially how I get from 2 instruments to 4, once I start a line, I''ll keep it going until there is a natural musical ending for it or the piece ends. lots of times, I know where I want the piece to end, so when I get close to that, I''ll write the ending and work backwards:

<img src="/images/blog/end.png"/>

That''s pretty much it. I don''t generally write using any kind of instrument, such as guitar or piano, although I do use Sibelius playback a fair amount to hear the overall structure and arc. This piece was easy to write, I needed it to be short enough so that I could repeat it and stop as soon as they were done lighting the candles.<br/><br/>
<a href="/tmp/evan_diana.pdf">Here is a PDF</a> of the finished sketch, you can listen to a cheesy MIDI playback <a href="/tmp/evan_diana.mp3">here</a>.<br/><br/>
The last thing I need to do is adapt it to guitar and learn to play it, which for this was relatively easy as it''s a simple melody and harmonic background. I''ve recorded a version of me playing it which you can <a href="http://soundcloud.com/paulsanwald/wedding-song-for-evan-and"> listen to on soundcloud</a>.<br/><br/>
One final thing I''d like to add is that after writing a piece, I have to learn it like everyone else does. I have never had a piece memorized after writing it, and I will forget them unless I practice it regularly. The act of writing a piece does not burn it into my mind forever, many people, even musicians, seem to think this is the case. If a piece takes me a really long time to write, then I will usually have it memorized by the end, just by virtue of having heard it a zillion times, but most of the music I write, and without exception the best of the music I have written, has been written down start to finish with very little editing. This is one area where I think everyone is a little different, some of the greatest composers who ever lived have toiled over 4 bars for hours. I might be a better composer if I did this, but it''s just not my way and hasn''t really proved very productive for me in the past.<br/><br/>
This is probably my longest blog post ever, but I have found it pretty useful to describe a bit about what the composition process is currently like for me.<br/><br/>

INSERT INTO "wp_posts" VALUES (238,2,'2011-02-26 15:42:07','2011-02-26 19:42:07','When people find out I''m a composer, their reaction is usually something along the lines of "I could never do that", or similar. Writing music is one of the very, very few things that comes pretty naturally for me, but I understand the "I could never do that in a million years" feeling, because I am incapable of drawing even the most basic pictures.<br/><br/>
I thought I''d write up a post on how I generally write music, both because I think every composer is a bit different, and as a way of de-mystifying the process a bit for anyone reading that isn''t a musician (hi mom and dad!).<br/><br/>
My friends Evan and Diana asked me to write and play some music for the candle lighting ceremony for their wedding. This provided me with the first, most important thing I need in order to compose anything: A Deadline. there are many areas of life where I am very self motivated and productive: practicing guitar 3+ hours per day no matter what, waking up at ungodly hours of the morning to go boxing, shipping software at work, etc. Unfortunately, and maybe because it comes somewhat naturally, I am not very disciplined about composing and pretty much need some kind of deadline in order to get anything done. Once I have a deadline, I think about the piece and generally procrastinate until I reach the point where I must get it done, which, for the purposes of Evan and Diana''s wedding, puts us at two saturdays ago, a week before the wedding. I have committed to playing, but haven''t written a note.<br/><br/>
First thing I do is fire up Sibelius, which is like a word processor for music. I used to write with a pencil and paper on score paper, but I stopped doing that years ago and usually write directly in Sibelius these days. Next, I decide what instruments I am going to use in my score. I am a guitarist, it is going to be just me playing at the wedding, why would I need to make this decision, shouldn''t I write a score for guitar? For plenty of composers, I''m sure the answer is yes. But for me, I want to write something beautiful, majestic and stately, and when I think of those things, I think string quartet. I''ll write something for string quartet, and figure out how to play it on guitar later.<br/><br/>
I start with a blank score for 2 violins, viola, and cello. I decide on a waltz, and set the key to G. For me, the process of composing is a pushing and pulling of the melody and the harmony. in a string quartet, I generally start my sketch with the outer voices: a bass line, and a melody line. Sometimes, the bass line will suggest a melody line, and other times, the melody will suggest a harmony to go against it. One of the more interesting decisions you can make when composing is when to go against what first "suggests" itself in the other voice, my melody note may be D, and I may initially hear a G under it, but what if I decide to avoid that, and rather go for a Bb in the bass. It will mean I will have to re-write some parts from before, but that''s ok. Sometimes, this decision will ripple all the way back through the piece to the very beginning, and end up changing the character.<br/><br/>
For Evan and Diana''s piece, I actually wrote the first 4 bars of the bassline first, and decided to borrow an F chord instead of staying in G the whole time. I find it extra easy to write very nice tonal music and sometimes need to make a conscious effort to go outside the key a bit. my score now looks like this:

<img src="/images/blog/first.png"/>

I keep going with the violin and cello, but if I hear any inner lines, I go ahead and write them in. the ideas I have for those may take over the main melody, or suggest a harmony also. an example of that is the viola line in my sketch<br/><br/>
<img src="/images/blog/inner.png"/>

this process is essentially how I get from 2 instruments to 4, once I start a line, I''ll keep it going until there is a natural musical ending for it or the piece ends. lots of times, I know where I want the piece to end, so when I get close to that, I''ll write the ending and work backwards:

<img src="/images/blog/end.png"/>

That''s pretty much it. I don''t generally write using any kind of instrument, although I do use Sibelius playback a fair amount to hear the overall structure and arc. This piece was easy to write, I needed it to be short enough so that I could repeat it and stop as soon as they were done lighting the candles.<br/><br/>

Once I have a deadline, I think about the piece and generally procrastinate until I reach the point where I must get it done, which, for the purposes of Evan and Diana''s wedding, puts us at two saturdays ago, a week before the wedding. I have committed to playing, but haven''t written a note.<br/><br/>
First thing I do is fire up Sibelius, which is like a word processor for music. I used to write with a pencil and paper on score paper, but I stopped doing that years ago and usually write directly in Sibelius these days. Next, I decide what instruments I am going to use in my score. I am a guitarist, it is going to be just me playing at the wedding, why would I need to make this decision, shouldn''t I write a score for guitar? For plenty of composers, I''m sure the answer is yes. But for me, I want to write something beautiful, majestic and stately, and when I think of those things, I think string quartet. I''ll write something for string quartet, and figure out how to play it on guitar later.<br/><br/>
I start with a blank score for 2 violins, viola, and cello. I decide on a waltz, and set the key to G. For me, the process of composing is a pushing and pulling of the melody and the harmony. in a string quartet, I generally start my sketch with the outer voices: a bass line, and a melody line. Sometimes, the bass line will suggest a melody line, and other times, the melody will suggest a harmony to go against it. One of the more interesting decisions you can make when composing is when to go against what first "suggests" itself in the other voice, my melody note may be D, and I may initially hear a G under it, but what if I decide to avoid that, and rather go for a Bb in the bass. It will mean I will have to re-write some parts from before, but that''s ok. Sometimes, this decision will ripple all the way back through the piece to the very beginning, and end up changing the character.<br/><br/>
For Evan and Diana''s piece, I actually wrote the first 4 bars of the bassline first, and decided to borrow an F chord instead of staying in G the whole time. I find it extra easy to write very nice tonal music and sometimes need to make a conscious effort to go outside the key a bit. my score now looks like this:

<img src="/images/blog/first.png"/>

I keep going with the violin and cello, but if I hear any inner lines, I go ahead and write them in. the ideas I have for those may take over the main melody, or suggest a harmony also. an example of that is the viola line in my sketch<br/><br/>
<img src="/images/blog/inner.png"/>

this process is essentially how I get from 2 instruments to 4, once I start a line, I''ll keep it going until there is a natural musical ending for it or the piece ends. lots of times, I know where I want the piece to end, so when I get close to that, I''ll write the ending and work backwards:

<img src="/images/blog/end.png"/>

That''s pretty much it. I don''t generally write using any kind of instrument, such as guitar or piano, although I do use Sibelius playback a fair amount to hear the overall structure and arc. This piece was easy to write, I needed it to be short enough so that I could repeat it and stop as soon as they were done lighting the candles.<br/><br/>
<a href="/tmp/evan_diana.pdf">Here is a PDF</a> of the finished sketch, you can listen to a cheesy MIDI playback <a href="/tmp/evan_.diana.mp3">here</a>.<br/><br/>
The last thing I need to do is adapt it to guitar and learn to play it, which for this was relatively easy as it''s a simple melody and harmonic background. I''ve recorded a version of me playing it which you can <a href="http://soundcloud.com/paulsanwald/wedding-song-for-evan-and"> listen to on soundcloud</a>.<br/><br/>
One final thing I''d like to add is that after writing a piece, I have to learn it like everyone else does. I have never had a piece memorized after writing it, and I will forget them unless I practice it regularly. The act of writing a piece does not burn it into my mind forever, many people, even musicians, seem to think this is the case. If a piece takes me a really long time to write, then I will usually have it memorized by the end, just by virtue of having heard it a zillion times, but most of the music I write, and without exception the best of the music I have written, has been written down start to finish with very little editing. This is one area where I think everyone is a little different, some of the greatest composers who ever lived have toiled over 4 bars for hours. I might be a better composer if I did this, but it''s just not my way and hasn''t really proved very productive for me in the past.<br/><br/>
This is probably my longest blog post ever, but I have found it pretty useful to describe a bit about what the composition process is currently like for me.<br/><br/>

First, let''s take a look at the piano music. The piece, a waltz, has kind of an 8 bar intro, followed by the "A section", a theme in tempo. He then revisits the rhythmic material of the intro, but with new harmony, and segues into what I''ll call the "B section", another more rhythmic theme, ending with the "intro" rhythmic material, again with different harmonies. The "A section" is played a second time, but this time with accompaniment above the melody, and brings us to the dynamic climax of the piece, about 3/4 of the way through. The "B section" phrases are now also played in the middle register, and the piece then concludes.<br/><br/>
The orchestral version is really written to feature the flute. The "A section" theme (12) is played by solo flute in a relatively low register, and then doubled on the english horn. Strings and Harp provide accompaniment, with some pizzicato in the bass notes. After the "A section", the intro material (13) is played by the woodwind choir plus second violins and cellos up high. This provides a lot of contrast to the "B section" (14), which is again flute supported by strings and harp. 

(15) The "intro material" at rehearsal 15 is the only time the strings really have the melody, they give it back to the flute at 16 with 2 harps plus celeste(!), and strings "sur la touche". Rehearsal 17 brings the climax of the piece with the full woodwind choir plus strings, before giving it back to flute, strings and harp at rehearsal 18 to take the piece out. trumpets only play a little accompaniment twice, there are no trombones at all. The horns are also used mostly as accompaniment.<br/><br/>
From an orchestration perspective, he really builds the piece nicely and provides quite a lot of contrast by alternating the "theme" sections with more coloristic sections using the woodwind choir.

We went for the french quarter festival, which is a great, free, mostly local festival that is carried out on free stages all around the french quarter.<br/><br/>
On our first trip last year, we mostly stayed out of the quarter; partly because it seemed too touristy to be interesting, partly because we love to walk all over cities and the quarter is a small part of New Orleans, and partly because we stayed in the Treme, which was a hike from the Quarter.<br/><br/>
This year, we stayed in the Marigny, just a few blocks away from the best street in new orleans for live music, and nightlife in general: Frenchman Street. We got in on a wednesday evening, got settled and headed over to D.B.A to check out the Tin Men, a trio featuring Sousaphone, Washboard Chaz and Guitar. Everyone in the band is an excellent musician and I feel lucky to have seen Washboard Chaz play live, a truly unique musician.

We were also lucky enough to meet Errol for the show and a drink. Afterwards, we headed to Cochon for dinner, which was the only place we decided to eat at again from our last trip. This time, we had broiled oysters, ribs with watermelon pickle, fried green tomatoes with shrimp remoulade, and rabbit and dumplings. Everything was amazing except for the fried green tomatoes, which were merely very good. We had enough room to share a Banana Cream Pie with chocolate cream for dessert, which was fantastic. Cochon is a great restaurant, and I''d recommend it to anyone visiting New Orleans.<br/><br/>
The next day we started the day with breakfast from Stanley, which is right on Jackson Square. The NYer in me mistrusts anyplace in or around the quarter, as I generally assumed the food would be priced for tourists and mediocre. Boy, does Stanley prove me wrong. We shared the bananas foster french toast and the eggs and oysters.

I am not big on fried oysters or hollandaise, but the eggs were perfectly done and quite tasty. Stanley is a great breakfast/lunch spot in the quarter.<br/><br/>
We then proceeded to take a streetcar over to audobon park, and walked the park followed by the entire length of magazine street, about 6 or 7 miles. At Errol''s recommendation, we stopped at Mahoney''s for po'' boys. The soft shell crab po'' boy on Leidenheimer''s bread was worth the wait.<br/><br/><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5184/5618148904_8944b61626_m.jpg" alt="mahoney''s" />

For Thursday night, where we left off, we stopped in the bar in Arnaud''s for a cocktail. The Bartender there, Chris Hanna, had been recommended to us by a bartender in brooklyn, and since I enjoy a Sazerac, we gave it a try. Chris Hanna pours the best Sazerac in New Orleans, or for that matter, anywhere else I''ve tried.<br/><br/>
We got a book on dining in new orleans that only included about a dozen places, the first 2 chapters of the book are all on one restaurant: Galatoire''s. Lunch is a tradition at Galatoire''s, but knowing that there are long lines for lunch, we had made reservations for dinner. Having eaten at Commander''s Palace on our last trip, we had high expectations. Unfortunately, although the food was quite tasty, service wasn''t great and our meal felt rushed. We had a seafood appetizer with crawfish, shrimp remoulade, and some fried oysters. I had the crawfish etouffe for dinner, Sarah had fried soft shell crabs. Everything was good, but we had high expectations, and as I mentioned everything felt a bit rushed. Maybe we just had a bad experience, but given the number of amazing restaurants in new orleans, I probably wouldn''t go back.<br/><br/>
We ended the night at the spotted cat, an awesome club on frenchman street, watching the moonshiners tear it up with 500,000,000 other enthusiastic music fans. I''ll say it again; Frenchman street is the best place to see tons of great music, there is always great stuff happening. DBA, The Spotted Cat, The Three Muses, Blue Nile, Snug Harbor, all have great music happening all night long, and they''re all on the same block!<br/><br/>
The next day, we decided to rent bikes at michael''s bicycles on frenchman to explore some parts of the city we weren''t familiar with. We biked up to the new orleans botanic gardens and saw some of the most beautiful roses I''ve ever seen<br/><br/><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5306/5617566977_f750a31da4_m.jpg" alt="roses!" />

after a morning around the botanic garden and city park, we decided to head to the french quarter festival. we stopped by the green goddess for lunch on complete accident, but they had wonderful food and I had a salad with stawberries, blueberries, red onion, goat cheese and pecans which was incredible:
<img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5261/5618155610_065a600ba6_m.jpg" alt="" />

sarah also had some kind of salad which looked amazing. After this, we biked down to the festival and checked out Leroy Jones and the Hurricane Brass Band, and some cajun/zydeco music, and finally met up with my friend <a href="http://www.sunnymehta.com/">Sunny</a>, who is a super interesting guy and kind of similar to me in that he is a jazz guitarist who plays poker. only I mostly stopped playing cards and sunny actually writes books about poker and is going to be in a movie soon.<br/><br/>
Brass band music, which is usually trumpet, tuba, trombone, sax, bass and snare drum, is culturally unique to new orleans. they seem to be a part of everyday musical life in new orleans, and I haven''t seen this music performed regularly anywhere else I''ve been or played. Leroy''s band played a pretty traditional mix of funk tunes like chameleon, with a solid amount of older standards like basin street blues mixed in.<br/><br/>
I have limited experience with cajun and zydeco, I generally like the more energetic stuff and don''t get into the slower waltzes and things like that.<br/><br/>
Friday ended with dinner at Brigtsen''s, another place we had read about in our book. Brigtsen''s is located way uptown, in a sleepy section of the city right across the street from another excellent restaurant, Dante''s. We had read about this in our book and couldn''t wait to try it, and we weren''t disappointed. Sarah started with the crawfish gratin and I had a green salad, Sarah continued the softshell crab marathon as her main course, while I had duck with a pecan balsamic reduction. both of our meals were excellent, and came with french whipped potatoes, the kind that are gluey in texture and delicious. Cook''s illustrated had a recipe for this style of mashed potatoes a while back, I never tried it but will have to give it a go next time we have company. Anyways, I would recommend Brigtsen''s to anyone visiting the city. If you take a cab, take the slow way up St. Charles and stay off the highway, it''s a prettier ride and probably safer.<br/><br/>
Afterwards, we went to DBA for a drink and caught a few tunes from an organ trio. good way to cap off a long day!<br/><br/>
