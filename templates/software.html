<h2>BeatDown Metronome</h2>
<p>I'm the developer of <a href="http://www.pineapplestreetsoftware.com/beatdown/">
BeatDown Metronome</a>, an iOS metronome application. I wrote it to teach myself
objective-C, and found it useful enough to release in the App Store. It's free,
and I enjoy practicing with it.

<h2>Web Development</h2>
<p>
Lately, I've been interested in RESTful web services, jQuery, python, and groovy.
I have a bunch of projects in progress over at <a href="https://github.com/pcsanwald/">my Github page</a>. The site you are reading now is part of my attempt to get 
better at jQuery, which is why it uses jQuery/javascript for lots of unnecessary
things.
